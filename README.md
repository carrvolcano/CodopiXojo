REE inverse model code

Codopi is a subroutine in Igpet.
Igpet (Carr and Gazel, 2017) has been freely available on the Igpet site since 2016 (Carr 2024). MJC plans to maintain the site for several more years. The site has compiled Windows and OSX versions available for free download. The REE inverse is in the Model option when a REE plot is made. Example data and an explanatory note are part of the Igpet download.

In May 2024 the REE inverse paper was submitted to G-cubed. The Codopi subroutine and associated SIAdjust subroutine will not run separated from the rest of Igpet but the logic of the inverse is writen here. Figure 5 in the submitted paper has a useful flowchart. When the paper is published many facets of the subroutine will be made more comprehensible,
